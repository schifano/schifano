	<li>IT Ethics
		<ul>
			<li>What are the ethical issues involved, as described in the article?
				<p>There are several ethical issues involved in both articles. The first article, "Ethics in IT: Dark secrets, ugly truths -- and little guidance," discusses violations in using company equipment, such as browsing pornographic or otherwise inappropriate content on work computers. When these situations arise, it would be the ethical duty of the IT personnel involved to report these incidents to higher management to handle. However, because companies often do not have a strong policy in place for handling ethical conflicts, people can be at risk of losing their jobs due to company politics. Even worse, there are fine boundaries between violating company policy and violating legal state or country policy. The risks involved in ethical negligence can be far more damaging in not just social disruption, but monetary consequences.</p>
				<p>The second article, titled, "Taking IT ethics seriously," touches on ethical issues involved with information technology automating many industries and reducing the number of blue and white collar jobs. Although technology can be an efficient business solution for improving processes or products, it comes at the costs of people and their livelihoods. The suggestion the article provides is to consider the impact a technology will make on people, rather than simply focusing on business models. This concept parallels the idea of environmental sustainability. For every tree that is cut down, plan another: for every job that is replaced, create another. In this way, society could have stronger ethical values for people in the workforce.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Who are the stakeholders in the above situations? How would you handle the situations if you were one of them?
				<p>The stakeholders in the above situation include corporations, workforce, and technology innovators. Corporations should have ethical standards in place when certain technologies risk replacing certain aspects of their workforce. In addition, any person involved with technology innovation may need to be more aware of how their product will impact people, and perhaps research some additional solutions in how people can work differently or contribute.</p>
				<p>If I was one of the people involved at risk of losing my job due to some technological advancement, I would quickly pick up learning how to program or engineer. Although some other traditional jobs are going away, there is an increase in need for technology engineers.</p>
			</li>
			<li>What are some relevant principles from the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice?
			<p>2.01. Disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any actual or potential danger to the user, a third party, or the environment, that they reasonably believe to be associated with the software or related documents for which they are responsible, or merely know about.<br>
				This principle relates to the conflict one man in the first article was having, where he was monitoring Internet browsing activity and had conflict deciding whether or not he should report the pornography being viewed by an executive. The idea is that any danger or harm, is dangerous or harmful, and since IT people have the privilege of accessing that information, it shoud be disclosed for the safety of others.</p>
			<p>2.07. Not put self-interest, the interest of an employer, the interest of a client, or the interest of the user ahead of the public's interest.<br>
				This principle relates to those who violate ethics in the IT space. The idea is that, a person could exploit information just to say that they can, such as downloading salry information, looking at inappropriate content, or perhaps even stealing. However, a person's own curiosity and or amusement should not come before the benefit of the public both employee and customer facing.</p>
			<p>6.09. Not promote their own interest at the expense of the profession.<br>
				This concept relates to the ethical principle that, a person is hired for and entrusted with a specific duty within a company. Therefore, that person must uphold that expectation for the benefit of others and the company, and not for themselves. When people act solely on the interest of themselves in violating ethical principles, they could potentially harm others and lose trust.</p>
